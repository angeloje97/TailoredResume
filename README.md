# Resume Tailor

An AI-powered desktop application that automatically tailors your resume and cover letter for specific job applications using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Overview

Resume Tailor analyzes job descriptions and intelligently customizes your resume by:
- Emphasizing relevant skills and experience that match the job requirements
- Using terminology and keywords from the job posting
- Maintaining authenticity while optimizing for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Generating tailored cover letters
- Tracking application history with match ratings and job quality metrics
- Automatically converting documents to PDF format

The application uses a PySide6 GUI to collect job information and leverages OpenAI's API to generate customized resumes from your base resume templates.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Tailoring**: Uses GPT models to analyze job descriptions and customize resumes
- **Multi-Format Output**: Generates both .docx and PDF versions of resumes and cover letters
- **Application Tracking**: History page with filtering by match rating, job quality, date range, and tech stack
- **Favorites System**: Mark and filter favorite applications for quick access
- **Archive Management**: Dedicated archive page to organize and review old applications
- **Configurable Models**: Choose from multiple GPT models (gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, etc.)
- **Audio Notifications**: Sound alert when document generation completes
- **Document Regeneration**: Regenerate resume and cover letter from any saved application

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows OS (for batch scripts and PDF conversion)
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Microsoft Word or compatible .docx editor (for template creation)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Option A: Using the install script (Windows)**
```bash
install.bat
```

**Option B: Manual installation**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `openai` - OpenAI API client
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
- `python-docx` - Word document processing
- `docx2pdf` - PDF conversion
- `PySide6` - GUI framework
- `pygame` - Audio notifications
- `icecream` - Debugging utility

### 2. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.

### 3. Prepare Your Base Resumes

The `BaseResumes/` folder should contain your source resume(s) in .docx format. These are the resumes the AI will use as a foundation for tailoring.

**What to include:**
- One or more .docx files with your complete work history, skills, and projects
- Include ALL your experience, skills, and accomplishments (the AI will select the most relevant ones)
- Multiple versions are fine (e.g., technical resume, management resume)
- Use clear, detailed bullet points with metrics and specific technologies

**Example structure:**
```
BaseResumes/
├── Resume2025_Technical.docx
├── Resume2025_Management.docx
└── Resume2025_General.docx
```

**Tips:**
- Don't worry about tailoring or length in base resumes - include everything
- Use specific numbers and metrics (e.g., "Reduced load time by 40%")
- List all technologies, frameworks, and tools you've used
- Include all projects, even if some won't fit on the final resume

### 4. Set Up Resume Template

The `Resources/Resume Template.docx` file defines the formatting and layout of your tailored resumes.

**Required placeholders** (surround with curly braces):

```
{Summary}                          - Professional summary (2-3 lines)

{Job1Title}                        - First job position and company
{J1Details1}, {J1Details2}...      - Job 1 bullet points (up to 6)

{Job2Title}                        - Second job position and company
{J2Details1}, {J2Details2}...      - Job 2 bullet points (up to 3)

{TechnicalSkillsCategory1}         - First skill category name
{TechnicalSkillsCategory1List}     - Skills list for category 1

{TechnicalSkillsCategory2}         - Second skill category name
{TechnicalSkillsCategory2List}     - Skills list for category 2

{TechnicalSkillsCategory3}         - Third skill category name
{TechnicalSkillsCategory3List}     - Skills list for category 3

{Certifications}                   - Professional certifications

{PersonalProject1}                 - First project name and tech stack
{P1Details1}, {P1Details2}         - Project 1 bullet points

{PersonalProject2}                 - Second project name and tech stack
{P2Details1}, {P2Details2}         - Project 2 bullet points
```

**Formatting tips:**
- Keep formatting simple and ATS-friendly (avoid tables, columns, graphics)
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Target one-page layout (32 usable lines)

**Example layout:**
```
{Summary}

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
{Job1Title}
• {J1Details1}
• {J1Details2}
• {J1Details3}

{Job2Title}
• {J2Details1}
• {J2Details2}

TECHNICAL SKILLS
{TechnicalSkillsCategory1}: {TechnicalSkillsCategory1List}
{TechnicalSkillsCategory2}: {TechnicalSkillsCategory2List}

PROJECTS
{PersonalProject1}
• {P1Details1}
• {P1Details2}
```

### 5. Set Up Cover Letter Template

The `Resources/Cover Letter Template.docx` file defines your cover letter format.

**Required placeholders:**

```
{Date}           - Letter date
{CompanyName}    - Company name
{Paragraph1}     - Opening paragraph
{Paragraph2}     - Body paragraph 1
{Paragraph3}     - Body paragraph 2/closing
```

**Example layout:**
```
{Date}

Hiring Manager
{CompanyName}

Dear Hiring Manager,

{Paragraph1}

{Paragraph2}

{Paragraph3}

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

### 6. Configure JSON Template (Optional)

The `Resources/Json Template.json` file defines the structure of AI responses. The default template is pre-configured, but you can customize it.

**Main sections:**

1. **Meta** - File naming and metadata
2. **Resume** - Resume content structure
3. **CoverLetter** - Cover letter structure
4. **Job** - Application tracking metadata

**Key points:**
- Arrays (lists) will be expanded to numbered keys (e.g., `J1Details: [1,2,3]` → `J1Details1`, `J1Details2`, `J1Details3`)
- Character limits are guidelines in comments (e.g., `"Summary": "(240 - 335 Characters)"`)
- Ensure placeholder names match your template .docx files exactly

**Example Resume section:**
```json
"Resume": {
    "File Name": "{Company Name} Resume",
    "Summary": "(240 - 335 Characters)",
    "Job1Title": "{Title} - {Company} | Jan 2023 - Jan 2025",
    "J1Details": [
        "Details1 (~93-210 Characters)",
        "Details2 (~93-210 Characters)",
        "Details3 (~93-210 Characters)"
    ],
    "TechnicalSkillsCategory1": "",
    "TechnicalSkillsCategory1List": ">89 Characters"
}
```

### 7. Add Notification Sound (Optional)

Add an MP3 file named `Notification Sound.mp3` to the `Resources/` folder. This will play when resume generation completes.

If no sound file exists, the application will still work but won't play audio notifications.

## Usage

## Customizing AI Behavior

Edit `Resources/Resume Prompt.md` to modify how the AI tailors resumes:

- **Analysis focus**: What to prioritize in job descriptions
- **Writing style**: Tone and phrasing preferences
- **Format constraints**: Line counts, character limits
- **ATS optimization**: Keyword strategies

The AI follows these instructions when generating each resume.

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not found"
- Ensure `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here` is set correctly
- No spaces around the `=` sign

### "Module not found" errors
- Run `install.bat` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or higher

### PDF conversion fails
- Ensure Microsoft Word is installed (required for docx2pdf on Windows)
- Check that .docx files are being created successfully first
- Try manually converting one .docx file to verify Word is accessible

### Templates not updating
- Click "Generate" to reload templates (they're reloaded each time)
- Verify placeholder names match exactly between template .docx and JSON template
- Check for typos in `{PlaceholderNames}` (case-sensitive)

### No notification sound
- Add `Notification Sound.mp3` to the `Resources/` folder
- Ensure the file is a valid MP3 format
- Check volume settings on your computer

### Resume exceeds one page
- Edit `Resources/Resume Prompt.md` to adjust line count constraints
- Reduce the number of bullet points in `Json Template.json` arrays
- Modify character limits in the prompt

## Advanced Configuration

### Changing the GPT Model

**Via GUI:**
- Go to Settings page (⚙️)
- Select model from dropdown
- Changes save automatically to `Config.json`

**Via Config.json:**
```json
{
    "Settings": {
        "Auto Archive Expired Applications": true,
        "Auto Archive Expired Favorite Applications": false,
        "GPT Model": "gpt-5-mini"
    }
}
```

Available models are listed in `Config.json` under `Resources.Available Models`.

### Adding Custom Base Resumes

Simply add more .docx files to the `BaseResumes/` folder. The application will:
- Automatically scan all .docx files in the folder
- Combine content from all resumes
- Use the combined text as context for the AI

This is useful if you have different resume versions for different career paths.

### Using Favorites

Mark important applications as favorites for quick access:

**To mark as favorite:**
1. Go to Files page (🗂️) or Archive page (📦)
2. Expand the application
3. Click the ⭐ button (turns green when favorited)

**To filter favorites:**
1. Check the "⭐ Favorites" checkbox at the top of the page
2. Only favorited applications will be displayed
3. Combine with other filters (search, rating, quality, date)

**Use cases:**
- Track high-priority applications you're actively pursuing
- Mark applications with great match ratings for follow-up
- Highlight companies you're most interested in
- Quickly access applications you want to tailor further

### Archiving Applications

**Manual archiving:**
1. Go to Files page (🗂️)
2. Expand the application you want to archive
3. Click the 📦 Archive button
4. The application is moved to `Resources/Json Data/Archived/`

**Viewing archived applications:**
1. Navigate to the Archive page (📦)
2. View all archived applications with the same filtering options
3. Expand items to review details
4. Click ↩️ Unarchive to restore an application to the Files page

**Benefits of archiving:**
- Keep your active Files page focused on current applications
- Maintain historical records without cluttering the main view
- Easily filter between active and archived applications
- Quickly unarchive if you need to reference or regenerate documents

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Detailed Base Resumes**: Include as much detail as possible in your base resumes. The AI will select what's relevant.

2. **Specific Job Descriptions**: Paste the complete job posting, including requirements, responsibilities, and company info.

3. **Review Generated Content**: Always review the AI-generated resume before submitting. Verify accuracy of all claims.

4. **Iterate on Templates**: Adjust the Resume Prompt.md instructions based on results to improve future generations.

5. **Track Match Ratings**: Use the match rating to prioritize which applications to pursue. The AI calculates this based on tech stack overlap, similar responsibilities, and experience level match.

6. **Use Favorites Strategically**: Mark high-match applications (8+) or companies you're most interested in to easily track your top opportunities.

7. **Archive Old Applications**: Keep your Files page organized by archiving applications after you've heard back or decided not to pursue them.

8. **Leverage Document Regeneration**: If you want to try a different approach, you can regenerate documents from any saved application without re-entering the job description.

9. **Customize Per Application**: The company and job title fields help the AI understand context, even if optional.

10. **Monitor Date Filters**: Use the "Today" filter to quickly see how many applications you've generated each day and maintain application momentum.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env` file**: Your OpenAI API key should remain private
- **API costs**: Each resume generation makes an API call. Monitor your OpenAI usage
- **Local processing**: All document processing happens locally; only text is sent to OpenAI API
- **Data storage**: Application history is stored locally in `Resources/Json Data/`
