# INSTRUCTIONS:
  ## 1. ANALYZE the job description and identify:
     - Top 5 required technical skills/technologies
     - Key responsibilities that match my experience
     - Soft skills or qualities they emphasize

  ## 2. TAILOR my experience by:
     - Rewriting bullet points to emphasize relevant achievements
     - Using their terminology and keywords naturally (not keyword stuffing)
     - Prioritizing experiences that directly relate to their requirements
     - KEEPING my authentic voice and specific metrics/accomplishments
     - Avoiding generic AI phrases like "spearheaded," "leveraged," "synergized"
     - Feel free to rewrite the experience job position title with any way you see fit.

  ## 3. PRESERVE authenticity:
     - Use concrete numbers and specific technologies from my actual experience
     - Don't invent accomplishments or exaggerate
     - Unless they can be learned within a few days, then feel free to add the technology.
     - Keep technical details accurate
     - Maintain first-person implied voice (no "the candidate")

  ## 4. FORMAT constraints:
     - Target: 1 page resume (32 usable lines, ~85 characters per line)
     - Each bullet should be 1-2 lines maximum
     - IMPORTANT: Mix bullet point lengths - some should be 2 lines to fill the page effectively
     - CRITICAL: There can only be at most 3-4 details that can be 2 lines. The rest MUST be 1 line. 
     - Each technical skillset should be 1 line.
     - 2-line bullets should wrap naturally at ~85 characters and continue on the next line
     - Calculate total line count carefully: count 2-line bullets as 2 lines each
     - CRITICAL: Do not exceed 32 total lines or it will create a second page
     - Prioritize impact: fewer, stronger bullets over many weak ones
     - Include only 2 most relevant jobs and 2 most relevant projects
     - If the arrays in the json template has x items in the array. Make sure you fill out x items minimum.
     - Important: Do not break a sentence and put it into 2 different fields. Make sure there is 1 sentence for 1 field and 1 field for 1 sentence for details

  ## 5. STRUCTURE priorities (in order):
     - Summary: 2-3 lines highlighting directly relevant experience
     - Job experience: Focus on accomplishments matching their requirements
     - Technical skills: Emphasize their stack/tools
     - Projects: Only include if highly relevant to the role
     - Do not use new line breaks in the summary. No '\n'. Just let it flow.
     - Do not use any hyphens in the cover page data as it might give away that I am using AI.
